      <article>
        <p>
          I was born and raised in{" "}
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro" target="_blank">Rio de Janeiro</a>, Brazil. From an early age, I was curious about how things worked, and I found in programming the perfect tool to bring ideas to life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wrote my first lines of code at the age of 13, driven by the desire to solve small daily problems with technology. By age 14, I had already dedicated a large part of my day to programming. Since then, coding became more than just a skill, it became my passion and career.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the past years, I&apos;ve worked professionally as a fullstack developer, mostly with{" "}
          <strong>.NET</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, and <strong>Angular</strong>. I love building scalable systems and crafting intuitive user interfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;m always exploring ways to grow as a developer, whether through side projects, open source, or deep dives into performance and architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;m also a huge fan of automation and productivity. I&apos;ve built internal tools to speed up workflows and enjoy experimenting with new technologies to improve developer experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work, you’ll probably find me listening to music, playing games, or diving into tech communities, sharing what I learn and learning from others.
